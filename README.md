# TheMapGame

Hi,

This is a small 2-d platformer game using the basic debugger window.

The objective is to travel the map using WASD keys and collect all the '$' symbols.
You cannot see the whole map but only the camera which follows you around and dislays
your nearby areas. The map is read from a basic text file.

It is a display of my understanding of:
  1. Object Oriented Programming (I create a map object which acts as the game)
  2. file reading using fstream functions
  3. implementation of difficult functions (camera and display function)
  4. proper comment etiquette to help understanding of my code
